I love books. I enjoy reading the Bible. I read books on biblical subjects, ancient Christian faith, doctrine and practices. Books on Rust, Python, Go, operating systems and packet inspection. I enjoy [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/) and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/). Just discovered I really like [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and the [Arco](https://arcolinux.com/) desktop.

I am a Struggling Christian, loyal husband, father and grandfather (papa).
