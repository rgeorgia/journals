### Infinity Desktop - It may take forever...

Started as an attempt to roll a NetBSD desktop. However the direction of the project has changed to use [DragonflyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/) instead.

I have always loved NetBSD and I still do; but I am super taken with DragonflyBSD, mainly because of the Hammer2 file system. I am not saying it’s the best BSD distro, it just seems to have a magnetic pull on me. Their network stack is so fast and responsive. Consequently, I want to make a good desktop experience with a solid operating system under the hood leveraging hammer2.

### First

I am not an expert, but I am willing to dig in, willing to learn and willing to listen to sound advice. I do not feel that everything needs to be “invented here.” I am more than willing to rip-off good ideas.


### Second

I am not a NetBSD or DragonflyBSD zealot. I am a DragonflyBSD enthusiast with a minor in NetBSD. I will not bash Windows or scoff at any distro of Linux. I will, however, try to learn from them, borrowing the good ideas and avoiding painful ones.

I will also not try to make Infinity DE a Windows-like, Mac-like or Linux-like; it will be minimal lightweight desktop built on FVWM and XDM. Honestly, this may not be for everyone.

Roadmap and other misc things are on our wiki

Totally inspired by the good folks that brought you [GhostBSD](https://ghostbsd.org/)! GhostBSD is built on TrueOS, which is another excellent project. We totally recommend you check them out. Some of us even support them financially. Yup we love GhostBSD!

The other major “kick in the pants” which I needed came from the author of OS108. Jay is a great guy and I would also recommend that you visit his github repo and an excellent forum he setup called [UnitedBSD](https://www.unitedbsd.com/).
